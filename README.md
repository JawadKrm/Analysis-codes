# Analysis codes
Analyzing peaks, recording them and other things

# NOTE: 
The code "FindPeak_average_PSD" contatins the method of optimal peak finding based ont the Scipy method "find_peaks" which has not been updated yet in the other codes that do peak finding. Go to "FindPeak_average_PSD" and find the function "find_beta_peak()" to see how it is done or go to https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.signal.find_peaks.html to find the method and its explanation.

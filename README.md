# Analysis codes
Analyzing peaks, recording them and other things

# NOTE: 
The method for peak finding that I used here is not the best, I am updating the code to a better method from SciPy go to https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.signal.find_peaks.html to find the method and its explanation.
